                            Starlight is a game engine I have been working on for a few months now, originally started as a voxel rpg game inspired by Minecraft and Terraria,
                            but then evolved into it's own game engine (all of the voxel things were removed.) 
                            I started Starlight Engine mostly because I feel like I matured from the last engine I used 
                            and wanted to make my own engine for me and my friends to use.
