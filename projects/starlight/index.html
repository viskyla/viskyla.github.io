                            I got the physics engine to delete the physics objects at a certain height (-100) and now I have to work on collision.<br>
                            You can also spawn (throw) objects now by clicking, which is pretty cool, make sure to look out for v25.8.9.1 because it should have quite the addition (OBB collision.)<br>
                            I would post an image or video here too but I am too lazy to as of right now, maybe in the next update?

                            I've been working on meshes and textures, also collisions too, but that's not finished yet.<br>
