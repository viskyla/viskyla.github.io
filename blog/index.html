                            My computer science class is sadly an intro so everything feels very "childish" if one might word it like that.

                            Quick note to the last blog: the rapid work on my game engine is not because of my computer science class, it is simply that I just got motivation again to work on it (maybe because of my computer science class, but I am not being forced to work on it.)

                            I am now in a computer science class so you can expect to see some portfolio stuff soon!<br>
                            I honestly dont even remember putting up a portfolio page so I should probably add that soon.
