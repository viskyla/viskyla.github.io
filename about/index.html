                                <li>
                                    I have two cats, KitKat and Olove &lt;3 (miaou!)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I love the concept of spoken languages and alphabets, and have made a few of my own!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I love building computers, and love working on random electrical contraptions.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I used to host servers for a variety of different things, although they are not up anymore due to bandwidth reasons.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h1>What do I enjoy doing?</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I love programming, but I also find fun in some other things!</li>
                            <li>I quite like photography, making art, making music, and playing games!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h1>Significant things I've done</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I've started a game studio called <a href="/lykvid/">Lykvid</a> with a friend, and we work on random projects together.</li>
                            <li>I have also made a few decently popular games, but sadly sold a few of them off, which turned out to be a horrible idea, although now I know to always keep my work with me.</li>
                            <li>I can grow communities very well, so that's also pretty cool, although right now I'm trying to lay low so I can finish things first.</li>
                            <li>I taught myself lua and C++ from pretty much only trial and error.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I like architecture (And possibly interior design.)</li>
